## PwnDoc to Reconmap

[PwnDoc][pwndoc] to [Reconmap][reconmap]

### Converting vulnerabilities

Prerequisites:

- probably any version of Ruby 2.X and 3.X
- [kramdown](https://rubygems.org/gems/kramdown/) gem

Usage:

```shell
ruby pwndoc2reconmap_vulns.rb 'pwndoc_vuln_file.yml' 'reconmap_vuln_file.json'
```

Example:

```shell
ruby pwndoc2reconmap_vulns.rb '/tmp/vulnerabilities_pwndoc_20210815.yml' '/tmp/reconmap-data-test.json'
```

Features:

- The fields `description`, `observation` and `remediation` from PwnDoc will be converted from HTML to Markdown (as Reconmap used it)
- The `cvssSeverity` field from PwnDoc will be used for the `risk` field of Reconmap

Limitations:

- As there is no _Multilingual vulnerability_ support yet in Reconmap ([#50][reconmap-50]) but there is in PwnDoc, a workaround is used to create an instance of vulnerability per language. So if you have French (fr) + English (en) locales in PwnDoc then two vulnerabilities will be created in Reconmap and the lang will be prefixed to the title. Example: `[en] SQL injection` and `[fr] Injection SQL`.
- The fields `priority` and `remediationComplexity` from PwnDoc will be lost since Reconmap doesn't support them yet ([#51][reconmap-51])
- The fields `category` and `vulnType` from PwnDoc will be lost until some points about the import behavior of Reconmap are clarified ([#52][reconmap-52])
- The `references` field from PwnDoc will be appended at the end of the `solution` field of Reconmap since there is not yet a `references` field on Reconmap ([#51][reconmap-51])
- Vulnerabilities will be marked as status open and sub-status reported because of the Reconmap DB architecture ([#54][reconmap-54])
- Custom fields from PwnDoc will be lost since there is not yet the possibility to add custom fields on Reconmap ([#51][reconmap-51])
- The creator id for Reconmap will be set to `1` (the default admin), if you want to change that modify the `creator_uid` and maybe `creator_full_name`; I don't know how it behaves yet ([#52][reconmap-52])

## Vulnrepo to Reconmap

[vulnrepo](https://github.com/kac89/vulnrepo/) to [Reconmap][reconmap]

### Converting vulnerability templates

Prerequisites:

- Ruby

Usage:

```shell
ruby vulnrepo2reconmap_vulns.rb 'vulns.json' 'reconmap_vuln_templates.json'
```
